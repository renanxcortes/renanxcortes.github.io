title: "tobler: a library for spatial interpolation in Python"
description: |
---

The [**tobler**]((https://github.com/spatialucr/tobler)) package is a library to deal with different approaches for spatial interpolation for extensive and intensive variables.

This package is gonna be part of the harmonization layer for the [**Geospatial Neighborhood Analysis in Python**](https://github.com/spatialucr/geosnap){:target="_blank"} (geosnap) package in Python. In this project, I'm working directly in different approaches to harmonize different set of variables to perform a uniform set of boundaries of any different set of divisions. The original idea of this project can be found [**here**](http://conference.scipy.org/proceedings/scipy2018/pdfs/serge_rey.pdf){:target="_blank"}.

The functions can comprise areal interpolation and also auxiliary variable (such as satellite images of the National Land Cover Dataset). For more information about these methods, you can check [**this paper**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/5153750_Areal_Interpolation_of_Population_Counts_Using_Pre-Classified_Land_Cover_Data){:target="_blank"} and [**this R package**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/areal/vignettes/areal.html){:target="_blank"}.

In addition, we are refining these methods to be executed at scale, using [**GeoSpark**](https://github.com/DataSystemsLab/GeoSpark){:target="_blank"} and [**optimized algorithms for raster data, such as the scanline**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/328949782_Distributed_zonal_statistics_of_big_raster_and_vector_data){:target="_blank"}.
